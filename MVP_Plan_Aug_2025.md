## August 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the path to MVP launch for the Commit sales commission tracking platform. Based on a comprehensive audit, the application is approximately **80% feature-complete** but requires critical security and data consistency fixes before market launch. With focused effort, we can achieve MVP readiness within **2-3 weeks**.

## 1. Current State Assessment

### âœ… What's Working Well

- **UI/UX**: Clean, modern interface with responsive design

### ðŸ”´ Critical Gaps for MVP
1. **Security vulnerabilities** (JWT secrets, exposed credentials)
2. **Data precision issues** (monetary calculations, timezone handling)
3. **Missing CRM integrations** (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive)
