# Frontend/Backend Endpoint Mismatch Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The frontend was calling a non-existent endpoint for deal categorization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend API Client Update
**File**: `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- Changed endpoint from `/dashboard/deals/${dealId}/category` to `/deals/${dealId}/categorize`
- Updated request body to match backend expectations (`deal_type` instead of `category`)
- Added TODO comments for future ML tracking fields

### 2. Backend Cleanup
**File**: `backend/server-working.js`
- Removed duplicate `/api/deals/:dealId/categorize` endpoint (lines 436-550)
- This endpoint was already properly implemented in `backend/routes/deals.js`

## Current State

### Working Endpoint
- **URL**: `/api/deals/:dealId/categorize`
- **Method**: PATCH
- **Location**: `backend/routes/deals.js:421`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "deal_type": "commit|best_case|pipeline",
    "previous_category": "string",
    "categorization_timestamp": "ISO date string",
    "user_context": {
      "categorization_method": "manual|drag_drop",
      "session_id": "string"
    }
  }
  ```

### Frontend Usage
1. **Deals Page** (`frontend/src/pages/deals/index.tsx`): Already using correct endpoint
2. **Dashboard API** (`frontend/src/lib/api.ts`): Now fixed to use correct endpoint
3. **useDashboard Hook**: Defined but unused - uses the dashboardApi which is now fixed

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test deal categorization from the deals page drag-and-drop interface
2. Verify activity logs are being created for categorization events
3. Check that managers can categorize team members' deals
4. Ensure pipeline category properly removes categorizations

## Next Steps
Consider implementing the TODO fields in the frontend for better ML tracking:
- `previous_category`: Track what category the deal was in before
- `categorization_timestamp`: Record exact time of categorization
- `user_context`: Capture how the categorization was made (drag_drop, button click, etc.)
